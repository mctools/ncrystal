DummyPlugin:
  github_repo_key: "mctools/ncrystal"
  repo_subdir: "examples/plugin"
  description: |
    A (silly) example from the NCrystal source repository, serving as a template
    for other plugins. This example shows how to create a plugin which actually
    modifies scattering physics.

DummyDataPlugin:
  github_repo_key: "mctools/ncrystal"
  repo_subdir: "examples/plugin_dataonly"
  description: |
    A (silly) example from the NCrystal source repository, serving as a template
    for other plugins. This example shows how to create a plugin which only
    provides a static set of NCMAT files.

CrysText:
  github_repo_key: "highness-eu/ncplugin-CrysText"
  description: |
    A plugin providing texture models. Note that this plugin has some known
    numerical issues and is slow for shorter wavelengths.

MagScat:
  github_repo_key: "highness-eu/ncplugin-MagScat"
  description: |
    A plugin providing paramagnetic scattering in O2-clathrates, based on
    formulas by O. Zimmer (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.93.035503).

SANSND:
  github_repo_key: "highness-eu/ncplugin-SANSND"
  description: |
    A plugin to provide small angle neutron scattering for nanodiamonds.

    Models and benchmarking are described in
    N. Rizzi, et al. (https://doi.org/10.1080/00295639.2023.2196926).

nxslib:
  github_repo_key: "mctools/ncplugin_nxslib"
  description: |
    NCrystal plugin for loading .nxs files. Also includes a small database of
    .nxs files.

WaterData:
  is_on_pypi: true
  github_repo_key: "mctools/ncrystal-extra"
  repo_subdir: "pypkgs/ncrystal-plugin-WaterData"
  description: |
    Extra NCMAT data files for light and heavy water, covering a wider range of
    temperatures compared to what is found in the NCrystal standard library.

    The data files were based on ENDF/B-VIII.0 CAB scattering kernels by
    J.I. Márquez Damián, et. al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anucene.2013.11.014).

UraniumOxideData:
  is_on_pypi: true
  github_repo_key: "mctools/ncrystal-extra"
  repo_subdir: "pypkgs/ncrystal-plugin-UraniumOxideData"
  description: |
    Extra NCMAT data files for Uranium Oxide (UO2), with phonon densities
    optimised for various temperatures.

    Phonon density curves in the files are taken from: G. Noguere, et al., 2020
    (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.102.134312).

BzScope:
  github_repo_key: "tkittel/ncplugin-bzscope"
  description: |
    A plugin providing coherent inelastic kernels for isotropic materials, thus
    foregoing the incoherent approximation. The actual upstream location of this
    plugin is https://code.ihep.ac.cn/cinema-developers/ncplugin-bzscope but the
    plugin at that location has yet to be migrated to NCrystal4.
