# A pyproject.toml for injecting an empty ncrystal-core package. In case
# ncrystal-core is installed in a non-python aware fashion, installing this
# empty ncrystal-core package can be used to ensure that subsequent pip
# installations of packages needing ncrystal-core (like plugins for ncrystal)
# will not cause pip to pull down ncrystal-core from pypi. Of course, this is
# not bullet-proof, since "pip uninstall ncrystal-core" will only uninstall the
# empty package, not all of ncrystal-core content.
