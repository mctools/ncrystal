"""

Utilities for NCMAT creation, most notably the NCMATComposer helper class which
provides a pythonic and flexible object oriented interface for creating NCMAT
data representing a given material, and for verifying, writing, registering, or
loading said data.

"""

class NCMATComposer:
    """Helper class for composing an NCrystal material.

    One can either start with an empty instance, or bootstrap the process by
    starting the material from an existing NCMAT file, an NCrystal cfg-string,
    an NCrystal.Info object, a CIF file, or from a variety of files (anything
    that can be loaded with ASE and contains a suitable crystal
    structure). Depending on the specifics of the problem, one will then use
    various methods on the object to add or modify material information as
    desired, before ultimately the create_ncmat() method can be used to create
    the resulting NCMAT data. As a convenience the .write() and .register_as()
    methods can be used to write this data as a physical or virtual file
    respectively, or the .load() method can be used to directly load the
    data. Finally, the .plot_xsect() and .inspect() methods can also be used to
    quickly load and investigate the material. It might also be useful to print
    the output of .create_ncmat(), to understand what material has been created.

    For a more in-depth discussion and usage examples, please refer to the
    example Jupyter-Lab notebooks in the
    https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal-notebooks repository.

    Note that the "labels" used in the various methods, to identify different
    atoms in the materials are custom user labels. They are simply a way to
    provide a handle associated with a particular atom role or species in the
    material. For many simple materials, all labels will simply have the name of
    the element or isotope ("Al", "Li6", "D", ...), and each type of element and
    isotope will only appear once in the material. That is certainly OK, for
    such simple materials, and in these cases there is no need to concern
    one-self with the atomic composition of each label, since it can be inferred
    from the label itself. However, sometimes different atoms of the same type
    will appear in more than one role in the material (i.e. there might be one
    group of loosely bound aluminium atoms, while a different group of aluminium
    atoms are more tightly bound). Or, it might be that a given label is
    actually associated with an actual mix of elements of isotopes (i.e. a label
    might be associated with a particular isotopic enrichment, or a
    multi-element mixture). In these cases, each label should have it's precise
    composition defined with a call to the .set_composition(..) method.

    In other words: Unless the label happens to coincide with the name of an
    element or isotope ("Al", "Li6", "D", ...), its atomic composition MUST be
    defined by a call to the .set_composition(..) method. And if a given element
    has more than one role in the material, it must of course also have more
    than one label - one for each role (e.g. "tightAl" and "looseAl").

    To ensure high data quality and reliability, all crystalline materials will
    by default have their crystal structure verified for consistency with the
    indicated spacegroup, before it is converted to NCMAT data. For that reason,
    the third-party module "spglib" must be installed in order for this
    verification to take place (note that the .refine_crystal_structure() method
    can also be invoked before the material is used, to detect the spacegroup in
    if it was not provided). Fortunately, "spglib" is available both on PyPI and
    in the conda-forge conda channel.

        is provided, from a variety of data. Typically, the fmt parameter can be
        left out, but occasionally it might be needed to specify it
        explicitly. Supported fmt's are "cif", "cfgstr", "ncmat", (for NCMAT
        data), "info" (for NCrystal.Info or LoadedMaterial objects), ase (for
        ASE structures). Finally, the format "via_ase" is special, since it will
        always process the input with ASE, even if another more obvious format
        exists (i.e. CIF files will be processed via ASE first, not passed along
        directly to the NCrystal.CIFLoader). As an alternative to the "fmt"
        parameter, one can also invoke the various .from_xxx(..)  static
