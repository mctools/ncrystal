===== License and copyright info concerning code in the ncrystal_extra/ subdirectory ======
===========================================================================================

The optional NCrystal modules provided by code in the ./ncrystal_extra/nxslaz/
directory enables NCrystal to load crystallographic information from .nxs, .laz
and .lau files in addition to the native .ncmat files. It uses code from two
third-party open source C-libraries, nxslib[1] and SgInfo[2], which for
convenience have all been collected into just two files: NCNXSLib.hh and
NCNXSLib.cc. Naturally, using code from ./ncrystal_extra/nxslaz/ implies that
the license requirements of both nxslib and SgInfo have to be fulfilled. These
requirements are included at the top of both NCNXSLib.hh and NCNXSLib.cc and are
also repeated here in this file (see below).

Other files in the ncrystal_extra/ directory were written by the NCrystal
developers and is released under the same Apache 2.0 license as the rest of the
NCrystal files. Please refer to the general NOTICE and LICENSE files found at
the root directory of the NCrystal distribution for more information.

// This header and associated source file contain both the NXS Crystallography library (Mirko      //
// Boin, HZB) [nxslib] and the Space Group Info library (Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve) [SgInfo], with  //
// modifications by NCrystal developers (clearly marked by comments in the code and reachable by   //
// searching for "NCrystal"). The modifications include a few bug-fixes, but were mainly needed    //
// in order to be able to contain all of both nxslib and SgInfo sources in a single .hh/.cc file   //
// pair, compilable as C++ and protected by a namespace. Both nxslib and SgInfo sources were       //
// lifted from the NXSG4 distribution (http://cern.ch/nxsg4/), since they were both reproduced     //
// there with clear license text, repeated in the following:                                       //
