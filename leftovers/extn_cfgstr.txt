The "extn" parameter can by used to enable extinction effects, arising when the
microscopic blocks of perfect crystals (also known as coherent domains or
crystallites) reaches a significant size, resulting in interference between
direct and diffracted neutron waves. In addition to this primary extinction
effect, one might also have secondary extinction effects arising from multiple
scattering within a single grain, when the orientation of the crystallites
within a grain are correlated appropriately (e.g. with a mosaic spread around a
common orientation). The grain size is thus strictly larger than the block size
in this scenario. Different models exists with which to describe these effects,
and each model will have slightly different parameters available. Please refer
to LINKTODOCHERE for the full

Different The syntax

The secondary extinction effect modelled in this manner is thus very similar to
the extinction effects




@mdl: string for selecting a model. Default value is "sabine".

The choice of @mdl determines which other parameters are available, although
@blksz is always there and required.

The special case of a string with no @ and no : characters will be interpreted
as a single length value, the @blksz with @mbld=sabine.

@blksz: short for "block size", length unit.

`@mdl:sabine`:  (the default model)
=================================

The default model, bla bla.
Bla bla bla bla.

Simple way for specifying l or l+gG+L:

"bla.ncmat;extn=10um" (simplest primary extinction, sabine model with 10um domain size).
"bla.ncmat;extn=10um/100um/1deg" (simplest way to specify scnd extinction model: sabine+rect+corr))
"bla.ncmat;extn=-/100um/1deg" (simplest way to specify pure scnd extinction model, sabine+rect))




l=0 means "no primary" and L=0 means "no secondary". Might raise error if not
possible. (we could allow the string '-' to mean 0 in this sense)

This effectively sets: { Length blockSize, Optional<Length GrainSize, Mosaicity>}

After this, we can use keywords (note that cr always needs gG+L, and that red
never support these):

/sabine[_rect|_tri][_corr|uncorr]/
/bc[_gauss|lorentz|fresnel]/
/cr/
/red/<valR>/<vall>/<valc>


    //   Length bendingRadius // R;
    //   Length mfpElasDeformedRegions; // l
    //   Optional<double> deformationGradient; // c


"bla.ncmat;extn=10um"
"bla.ncmat;extn=10um/bc"

"bla.ncmat;extn=@mdl:sabine@blksz:10um" : Sabine primary extinction model.

"bla.ncmat;extn=@mdl:sabine@blksz:5um@mos:1e-3deg@grnsz:100um" : Sabine secondary extinction model.

"bla.ncmat;extn=@mdl:sabine@blksz:5um@mos:1e-3deg@grnsz:100um@corr:0" : Sabine secondary extinction model (uncorrelated).

"bla.ncmat;extn=@mdl:sabine@blksz:5um@mos:1e-3deg@grnsz:100um@tiltmdl:rect@corr:0" : Sabine secondary extinction model (uncorrelated).




Consider: Crystallite sizes are also interesting if  SMALL (scherrer equation).

Perhaps crystallite size (blksz?) should be a separate parameter, which is
always required for extinction models? If set, NCrystal will by itself determine
if a extinction model or some other model is required to be automatically enabled..


 coherent diffraction domain ('particle size')


"... is the mean size of the ordered (crystalline) domains, which may be smaller or equal to the grain size, which may be smaller or equal to the particle size;"
