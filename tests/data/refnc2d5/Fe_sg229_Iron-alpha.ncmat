NCMAT v2
#Alpha iron (ferrite, BCC). Can be used to model low-carbon steel, where it is
#the primary phase.
#
#Crystal structure was converted from the cif file of the entry 0011214 in the AMCSD.
#Additional reference: Wyckoff R W G, Crystal Structures, vol. 1, p. 7-83, 1963.
#
#The Debye temperature is derived from the Debye-waller factor at 293K compiled
#in the supplement of Acta Cryst., A52, p. 456-470, 1996
#
#The VDOS curve was extracted by T. Kittelmann using the engauge digitizer
#software from Figure 5 of:
#
#   "Phonon Dispersion Relation for Iron"
#   V. J. Minkiewicz, G. Shirane, and R. Nathans
#   Phys. Rev. 162, 528 - Published 15 October 1967
#   https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.162.528
#
#The VDOS curve was validated with experimental data in:
#
#  T. S. Toellner, et. al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 71, 2112 (1997)
#  https://doi.org/10.1063/1.120448
#
#Finally it should be noted that the VDOS curve was compared with the one used
#to generate the alpha-Iron scattering kernel in ENDF/B-VIII (which uses a
#distribution due to Stedman, Almqvist, and Nilsson). It is essentially roughly
#compatible in shape, but the Minkiewicz distribution adopted for the present
#NCMAT file is more detailed.
