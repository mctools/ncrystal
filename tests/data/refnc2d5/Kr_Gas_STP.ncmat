NCMAT v2

#Natural Krypton. Non-enriched noble gasses such as this one can be modelled
#realistically using the freegas model of Geant4. The density is the value at
#STP (273.15K, 1atm) calculated with the ideal gas equation. The density value
#must currently (NCrystal v2.0.0) be manually changed by the user if modelling
#using different temperatures or pressures is desired (the formula is given
#below).

@DENSITY
  # Notice: We are hardcoding the STP values (273.15K, 1atm) here. For other
  # values of pressure and temperature, it can be calculated as:
  #
  #      density [kg/m3] = 1021.22 * ( P[atm] / T[K] )
  #
  # Which assumes a Kr mass of 83.798 amu.
