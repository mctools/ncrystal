NCMAT v2
#Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG if used as single crystal, suitable to model large
#mosaicity graphite monochromators or analysers).
#
#Crystal structure was converted from the cif file of the entry 0014675 in the AMCSD.

#The VDOS is the same as used to generate the scattering kernels shipped with
#the ENDF/B-VIII release (extracted from the file tsl-crystalline-graphite.leapr).
#
#With the addition of a VDOS curve in NCrystal v2.0.0, the Debye temperature was
#increased slightly from its former value (740.6K in NCrystal v1.0.0), in order
#to better reproduce total cross sections observed in data at short
#wavelengths. The resulting inelastic cross sections at long wavelengths seems
#to still be too low when comparing with measurements, which one can speculate
#as being a sign that the incoherent approximation is not very good for this
#strongly coherently scattering material, and that there are strong coherent
#effects in single-phonon scattering. This might be solved in the future by
#adding support for coherent scattering kernels. The experimental data used for
#comparison was R.B.Walton, et al. (1960, EXFOR id 11359002) and P.A.Egelstaff
#(1957, EXFOR id 21149003).
#
#Finally here is "magic comment" which ensures that NCrystal will model this as
#an anisotropic layered crystal, rotated around the third lattice axis:
