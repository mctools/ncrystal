usage: ncrystal_cif2ncmat CIFFILE [-o OUTPUT] [--debyetemp VAL] [--uisotemp VAL]
                          [<<other advanced options described below>>]

Script which can be used to generate NCMAT files from crystal structures in local
or remote CIF files. The script can optionally also compare existing NCMAT files
with online structures indicated in their comments.  It is essentially a command-
line front-end for the functionality provided by the NCrystal.cifutils Python
module. Behind the scenes, CIF data is loaded and processed with the gemmi and
spglib modules, which must be available on the system. They can be either
installed via PyPi ("python3 -mpip install gemmi spglib") or conda ("conda install
-c conda-forge gemmi spglib").

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is important to realise that while most CIF files contain
crystal structure information, most of them lack appropriate information about
atomic dynamics (i.e. atomic displacements, Uiso, Biso, mean squared
displacements, Debye temperature, phonon DOS, ...). Even when available as a Uiso
(or Biso) value in the CIF data, the CIF data usually does not specify which
temperature the Uiso value is associated with, making it meaningless. The
--uisotemp parameter can be used to manually specify the temperature at which any
Uiso in the file is valid (it might of course require the user to perform a bit of
detective work to figure out the correct value). In other cases, this script will
simply assign each atom a Debye temperature value of 300K and use that for
dynamics (the --debyetemp flag can be used to modify this value if desired). For
more detailed options, one can either manually edit the generated NCMAT data, or
use the Python API (specifically the CIFAnalyser class from the NCrystal.cifutils
module) which offers more options and flexibility than the present script.

Example invocations:

          $> ncrystal_cif2ncmat myfile.cif
          $> ncrystal_cif2ncmat myfile.cif --output=myfile.ncmat
          $> ncrystal_cif2ncmat myfile.cif --output=stdout
          $> ncrystal_cif2ncmat myfile.cif --uisotemp=25
          $> ncrystal_cif2ncmat myfile.cif --debyetemp=500
          $> ncrystal_cif2ncmat mpid::127
          $> ncrystal_cif2ncmat codid::9008460 --debyetemp=412

positional arguments:
  CIFFILE               CIF file to use as source. This can either be a path to a
                        physical file, or an online database ID, specified using a
                        syntax like "codid::1000055" or "mpid::127". Do not specify
                        with --valplot.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output, -o OUTPUT   Name of output NCMAT file (specify "stdout" to print to
                        stdout). If not supplied, a name will be automatically
                        generated. Alternatively, this can be used with --valplot to
                        force output to a pdf file
  --debyetemp VALUE     Fall-back Debye temperature value (kelvin) to use for all
                        atoms (default: 300.0K)
  --uisotemp VALUE      Temperature value (kelvin) associated with any atomic
                        displacement (Uiso/Biso) values in the input. Without this
                        parameter, Uiso/Biso values in the input will be ignored.
  --quiet, -q           Silence non-error output (automatic if --output=stdout).
  --noval               Do not validate generated NCMAT data by trying to load it.
  --remap COMP          Redefine the composition of elements in the input CIF data,
                        using a syntax like the one in @ATOMDB sections of NCMAT
                        files. Examples: "H is D" and "B is 0.9 B10 0.1 B11". Colons
                        can be used in place of spaces if desired ("H:is:D").
  --atomdata ATOMDATA   Provide or override atom data of particular elements and
                        isotopes, using a syntax like the one in @ATOMDB sections of
                        NCMAT files. Example: "Si 28.09u 4.1491fm 0.004b 0.171b".
                        Colons can be used in place of spaces if desired.
  --dynamics, -d FILE   Data file from which to copy over dynamics information
                        (matching up atoms based on Z-values). If this argument is
                        not provided, or if a required element is not present in the
                        indicated file, dynamics will be created with a fall-back
                        Debye temperature (cf. --debyetemp).
  --nomerge             Do not use same label for different non-equivalent positions
                        of the same atom species.
  --showcif             Simply show the input CIF data (mostly useful with mpid:: or
                        codid:: sources).
  --valplot [FILE ...]  List of existing NCMAT files which should be compared to
                        crystal structures directly taken from online DBs (thus
                        hopefully verifying that online DB references mentioned in
                        comments in those files are actually compatible). This will
                        launch interactive matplotlib plots, unless the --output
                        option is used to request pdf output (either as -opdf or
                        -osomename.pdf, where the former will autogenerate a
                        suitable name for the output PDF file
  --spacegroup SPACEGROUP
                        Override the space group, disregarding the spacegroup
                        embedded in the file.
  --via-ase             Load input file via ASE (this can be useful to support non-
                        CIF input files).
