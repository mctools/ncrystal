#    tungsten on their respective thermal conductivity evolution with temperature"

#The Debye temperature derived from the Debye-waller factor at 293K compiled in
#the supplement of Acta Cryst., A52, p. 456-470, 1996, is 257.7K. In the
#Crocombette 2015 paper from which the VDOS is taken, a value of 268K is
#extracted from the VDOS, and compared to an experimental value of 265K (see
#ref. 14 in the Crocombette paper). All three values are in excellent agreement,
#and for simplicity we simply use their average value below, which is 263.6K.
