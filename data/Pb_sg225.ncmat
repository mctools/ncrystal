#The Debye temperature derived from the Debye-waller factor at 293K compiled in
#the supplement of Acta Cryst., A52, p. 456-470, 1996 is 87.5K. On the other
#hand, Introduction to Solid State Physics (Charles Kittel, 2004), provides a
#value of 105K. Experimental data (EXFOR 14141002, G. Muhrer), indicates a flat
#total cross section for wavelengths lower than 1.5Aa. A result reproduced by
#NCrystal (v2.0) if using the average of the numbers as the Debye temperature,
#(87.5K+105K)/2~=96K, but not if using either of the values 87.5K and 105K. A
#value of 96K also seems consistent with the VDOS spectrum, and thus in general
#seems to be a reasonable choice.
